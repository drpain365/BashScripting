# BashScripting


Quick Nutshell: Bash is the language of the terminal and programming in it basically executes a bunch of terminal commands.

A .sh (bash) file with the contents:

  cat /etc/passwd
  ls
  clear

will execute those commands in that exact order. And will yield nothing because of the "clear" command at the end.

but a file with the contents:

  cat /etc/passwd
  ls

will print the contents of the /etc/passwd file and the results of ls.

What you should take away from this: Bash will show you the results of your commands executed top to bottom.
